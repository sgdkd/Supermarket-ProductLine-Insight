**Target Audience**: Retail Business Analysts and Store Managers

Understanding sales performance across different product lines is crucial for business strategies and profitability. This dashboard provides a straightforward view of supermarket sales, including key metrics such as net sales, gross profit, customer purchase behavior, and sales trends over time.

To address the challenge of managing diverse product categories and customer segments, the dashboard enables users to filter data by city and month, offering deeper insights into regional and seasonal variations. It also presents gender-based purchasing trends(interactive chart) and customer ratings, helping businesses tailor marketing strategies and improve customer experience.

By integrating interactive charts, filters, and key performance indicators (KPIs), this tool empowers stake-holders to visually compare and analyze data ensures that businesses can make data-driven decisions efficiently, leading to better resource allocation and increased revenue.

## App description

Deployed in shinyapps.io ðŸ‘‰ <https://zr2884.shinyapps.io/Supermarket-ProductLine-Insight/>

From Instructor Daniel, deploying via shinyapps.io means there's no need to record a video. Here is a brief introduction to this dashboard including addressing the challenging part.

The **two filters** on the left serve as **inputs**, controlling all other **outputs**. You can freely switch them to observe how the data changes. The **Sales by Gender** graph is an **interactive** chart. You can hover over different bars to see detailed numerical information through the tooltip.

### **Challenging Tasks:**

-   [x] Deploy your dashboard publicly on the web.

-   [x] Add additional inputs/outputs( more than six).

-   [x] Add advanced callback functionality

    -   Based on the selected filters, the **three sales cards at the top** dynamically calculate the **sum or average** values.

    -   Based on the selected filters, the **Sales by Gender** graph slices and sorts the data to determine the **top-purchased product cards**, and also calculate the sum.

    -   Based on the selected filters, the **Customer Rating** graph calculates the **average rating**, converting it from a 10-point scale to a 100-point scale.
